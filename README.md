# symm-map
This map is a rotationally symmetrical map designed for 6FFA games. Feedback is appreciated!

What is symmetrical:

The land shape
The terrain
The resources
The ruins
The initial barb camps
The start locations of players and CS
The initial position of your warrior
Natural wonders (Spain is completely broken on this map - mirror civs or ban/fruity draft recommended)

What is not:

The type of CS
The world wrapping - wraps on x-axis only

Install instructions:
Everyone in game needs to put the map script in their Maps folder. The default location is:
C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\Sid Meier's Civilization V\Assets\Maps

Known issues:

The map has only been tested with 6 players and 0, 6 or 12 CS. If you use different numbers, it may not function correctly.

The map has only been tested in single player.

Sometimes, something breaks and the symmetry is not applied properly. The land shape will still be symmetrical, but resources and natural wonders will not.

Some weird behaviour with resources e.g. sugar and marsh can spawn on a tundra tile

Strategic balance can be a bit hit or miss - but at least your opponents will have the same lack of resources that you do.

Map settings have less effect on the resulting terrain than usual. Default settings result in a map that's usually pretty heavy on jungle.

Your neighbours are deterministic i.e. player 2 always spawns 60 degress clockwise from player 1
